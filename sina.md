Sina Weibo is a Chinese  microblogging website. Akin to a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook, it is one of the most popular sites in China, in use by well over 30% of Internet users, with a market penetration similar to the United States' Twitter.It was launched by SINA  Corporation on 14 August 2009, and as of December 2012 has 503  million registered users.About 100 million messages are posted each day on Sina Weibo.

In March 2014, Sina Corporation announced a spinoff of Weibo as a separate entity and filed an IPO under the symbol WB. Sina retains 56.9% ownership in Weibo. The company began trading publicly on April 17, 2014.

Sina Weibo implements many features from Twitter. A user may post with a 140-character limit mention or talk to other people using "@UserName" formatting, add hashtags with "#HashName#" formatting, follow other users to make their posts appear in one's own timeline, re-post with "//@UserName" similar to Twitter's retweet function "RT @UserName", select posts for one's favorites list, and verify the account if the user is a celebrity. URLS are automatically shortened using the domain name  like Twitter's Official and third-party applications make users able to access Sina Weibo from other websites or platforms.

Additionally, users are allowed to insert graphical emotions or attach own image, music, video files in every post. Comments to a post can be shown as a list right below the post, the commenter can also choose whether to re-post the comment, quoting the whole original post, to commenter's own page.

Unregistered users can only browse a few posts by verified accounts. Neither unverified account pages nor comments to the posts by verified accounts are accessible to unregistered users.

-  Verification

Sina Weibo has an identification policy. It is like Twitter's verified account which could verify the identity of famous person, organization and so on. Once a user gets through the verification on the internet, a colorful V will be added behind their username. An orange V is for people while a blue one is for organizations and companies. Also there will be a graph and a declaration on its user page to show the verification. There are several kinds of verifications: personal verification, college verification, organization verification, verification for official accounts (accounts of government departments, social media platforms and famous companies) weibo master (people bind the accounts with their phone numbers and their followers). When the number of microblogs reach the threshold, they can apply the verification of "weibo master".

-  Clients

Sina produced mobile applications for various platforms to access Sina Weibo, the platforms include Android, iOS, Windows phone.Sina also released a desktop client for Microsoft Windows under the product name of Weibo Desktop.

-  International versions

Sina Weibo is available in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. The site also has versions catering to users from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Weibo is now developing its international version in English and other languages. On January 9, Sina Weibo created a partial English Version, most likely being a test run, but was soon taken down in a week.

For the Chinese version, you must be a Chinese citizen to use it. You will be asked to verify your identity either through a valid Chinese cellphone number or a valid Chinese citizen identification number.Sina Weibo's official iPhone and iPad application have English language options.

-  Other services 

Weilingdi (微领地)is another service bundled with Weibo that is similar to foursquare a location-based social networking website based on software for mobile devices, and which grew out of Sina's 2011 joint venture with GeoSentric's GyPSii. Sina's Tuding (图钉) photo-sharing service, similar to Instagram, is also produced by the same joint venture. In addition, Sina Lady Weibo (新浪女性微博) is another service, which specializes in women's interests. Sina weibo have also recently released a desktop version of weibo, available for free download at its websites

There are still some points to be improved.

Firstly, the option "favorite" shouldn't be put in the option "more". It's not convenient for people to find out their favorite things.

Secondly, if you don't follow others,you won't be allowed to visit his or her Weibo. (That's not true.)

Thirdly, ads should be limited.

Finally,it should make it possible for us to put more than 9 pieces of photos once.

What's more,bugs still exist.

Sometimes it will appear the flash back; and when someone is watching the small video,if he or she touches the screen carelessly,it'll get back to the main page.

Eventually,I have two more requirements.

Firstly,voice comment should be applied to the app. Secondly,it's better to add the critic function for others comments instead of just praising. 

To sum up,I love Weibo and I hope it could be better in the future.
